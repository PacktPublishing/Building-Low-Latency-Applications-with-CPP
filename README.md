**Develop a complete low latency trading ecosystem from scratch using modern C++**

## What is this book about?
C++ is meticulously designed with efficiency, performance, and flexibility as its core objectives. However, real-time low latency applications demand a distinct set of requirements, particularly in terms of performance latencies.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Gain insights into the nature of low latency applications across various industries
* Understand how to design and implement low latency applications
* Explore C++ design paradigms and features for low latency development
* Discover which C++ features are best avoided in low latency development
* Implement best practices and C++ features for low latency
* Measure performance and improve latencies in the trading system
